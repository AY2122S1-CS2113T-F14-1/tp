## About Loading and Saving Data
**Loading saved data:** 

Whenever you run the program, the program will **automatically** look for any
saved data in the relative storage path, `data/habits.txt`. 
* If the storage file is found, `File exists` will be printed. 
* If the storage file is not found, the program will create 
one for you at the relative storage path, `data/habits.txt`.

**Saving data:** 

* Everytime you make changes to any of your goals and habits, the changes
are **immediately** reflected in the storage file. This is to ensure that in the
event you closed the program without using the command `bye`, we can ensure that
**most of your data are saved**.
* Before you exit the program, the goals you set and the habits you have added
are **automatically** saved in a text file at the relative storage path, `data/habits.txt`.
