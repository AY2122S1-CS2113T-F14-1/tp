## Using this Guide
We understand there may be a lot to take in from this user guide. Here are some things to take note
which may make the guide more friendly and helpful.

### Terminology

Name     | Description                                                      | Example
-----    | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------
Goal     | A long term achievement you wish to accomplish.                  |`Lose 5kg by Dec`
Habit    | Checkpoints; small, actionable tasks to be done to achieve goal. |`Run 5km`
Interval | How often you want to repeat each habit                          |`Run 5km every 7 days` 

Here we distinguish between goals and habits. Although they are commonly used words, the way we
design _Ha(ppy)Bit_ is tightly integral to the way we define them above. We would also like you
to know that the purpose of `habits` is to break down daunting, colossal `goals` into easy, bite-sized
`habits`; tasks that you can complete within a day or as defined by your `interval`.

### Icons & Format
Unfamiliar symbols may confuse. Here is a comprehensive collection of all emojis and syntax we employ.  

> üìÉ **Notes**: important information you should take note off (especially if you encounter input errors)

> ‚ö† **Warning**: avoid doing the things mentioned here at all costs (unless you're feeling lucky)
 
> üí° **Pro-Tip!** additional information that may make your tracking journey easier

> üòÄ &#8594; Used to show developers' exuberance!!!

> üëç &#8594; Used to show developers' love and support for you.

## Features

Below are the commands supported by the application.
Each section describes the function of each command and its format.

**Command Format**
* Command may require one or more flags. You may choose to use the flags in any other but ensure that all flags for that
  command are present.\
  (e.g. `add` requires the `n/`, `g/` and `i/` flag, and possible variations include `add n/habit 1 g/1 i/1` and 
  `add i/1 n/habit 1 g/1`)
* Parameters enclosed in angle brackets `<>` are meant to be replaced.\
  (e.g. `view g/<goal_index>` could be `view g/1`)
* Parameters enclosed within curly brackets, `{}` are optional, although each command must have at least 1 parameter.

### Ask for Help: `help`
Ummm, I'm not sure what the commands are. Fortunately this command is here for you.\
This command displays a list of all possible commands.
If an invalid command is typed, this method will be invoked by default.

**Format:** `help`

**Output:**
```
Here are the list of commands:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Description                       | Format                                                                 |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Replace <> with relevant terms (Exp: <goal_name> --> goal 1)
* Items enclosed within { } are optional
* Use 'list' and 'view' to check the goal and habit indexes respectively

Press enter to return to command mode...
```

### Set a Goal: `set`
Sets a new goal for a long term achievement you wish to accomplish. Goals must have an end date while the goal type and
start dates are optional (well, we wouldn't you to be procrastinating on your goals right?)

**Format:** `set n/<goal_name> { t/<goal_type> s/<start_date> } e/<end_date>`

* Goal name can be any name of your choosing (make it meaningful otherwise you won't know what you're tracking).
* Dates must be in `DDMMYYYY` format. For example, 01 January 2021 must be written as `01012020`.
* Goal type is an optional parameter and can take one of the following arguments
  * `sl` &#8594; Sleep
  * `fd` &#8594; Food
  * `ex` &#8594; Exercise
  * `sd` &#8594; Study
  * `df` &#8594; Default (This will be the goal type if the parameter is omitted)
* Start date is an optional parameter. Omitting it will set the start date as today.

**Example:**\
Command 1: `set n/Reduce spending s/29102021 e/31122021`\
Command 2: `set n/Exercise more t/ex e/01012022`\
Command 3: `set t/fd e/31122022 n/Become a vegetarian`

Output 1: `The goal '[DF] Reduce spending' has been added.`\
Output 2: `The goal '[EX] Exercise more' has been added.`\
Output 3: `The goal '[FD] Become a vegetarian' has been added.`

> üìÉ If more than 8 numbers are used for the date, only the 1st 8 numbers will be treated as the date.

### List all Goals: `list`
Can't remember what goals you have? Use this command to list all goals that you have set. 
In addition, you get to view some useful statistics.

**Format:** `list`

**Example:**
```
Command: list
```

**Output:**
```
3 goal(s) currently being tracked:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Index   | Name                 | Type      | Start Date   | End Date     | Habit Count   | Completion Rate   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1       | Reduce spending      | Default   | 29-Oct-2021  | 31-Dec-2021  | 0             | Not Applicable    |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 2       | Exercise more        | Exercise  | 28-Oct-2021  | 01-Jan-2022  | 0             | Not Applicable    |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 3       | Become a vegetarian  | Food      | 28-Oct-2021  | 31-Dec-2022  | 0             | Not Applicable    |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

> üìÉ Goal index may change if a goal is deleted. e.g. deleting the goal `Exercise more` will cause the index of `Become
> a vegetarian` to change from 3 to 2.

### Update a Goal: `Update`
Updates an attribute (Name, Date, or Goal Type) of a goal specified by its index.\
(To err is human. That's why we have the `update` feature; designed to be more forgiving,
when we have the occasional oopsies. üëç )

**Format:** `update g/<goal_index> { n/<goal_name> t/<goal_type> e/<end_date> }`

**Example:**\
Command 1: `update g/1 n/Read more`\
Command 2: `update g/2 e/31122021`\
Command 3: `update t/sd g/1`

Output 1: `The goal name 'Sleep more' has been updated to 'Read more'.`\
Output 2: `The goal end date of goal 'Exercise more' has been changed from '01-Jan-2022' to '30-Nov-2021'.`\
Output 3: `The goal type 'Default' has been updated to 'Study'.`

> üìÉ Only one parameter can be updated at a time (to be changed to multiple parameters in v2.1)

### Remove a Goal: `remove`
Removes a goal specified by its index.\
(Life gets us sometimes. Things don't go as planned. But this isn't calling it quits. It's admitting
defeat today, but to return stronger to fight another time. We got ya fam.)

**Format:** `remove g/<goal_index>`

**Example:**
```
Command: remove g/1
```

**Output:**
```
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The goal '[SD] Read more' has been removed.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

> üìÉ Goal index may change if a goal is deleted. Use the `list` command to check what the new goal indexes are.

### Add a Habit: `add`
Adds a habit that is linked to a goal.\
(Habits are meant to easy and doable. Completing them over time, with consistent dedication, 
one of these habits will be the metaphorical straw that breaks the camel's back. Your goals reached,
without even pulling a muscle.)

**Format:** `add n/<habit_name> g/<goal_index> i/<interval>`
* name your habit with an action or task that is preferably achievable (e.g. Run 2.4km, Sleep at 10pm)
* 'Interval' is a number that indicates the period of time you have to complete the task before the next cycle
* 'Interval' defined as 0 means that you only have to complete the task once
* 'Interval' should be lesser than the number of days before the end date of the goal 
  (otherwise you only have to complete the task once - what's the point right?)

**Example:**\
Input 1: `add n/Run 2.4km g/1 i/7`\
Input 2: `add g/1 i/1 n/Do 20 pushups`\
Input 3: `add i/14 n/Learn a vegetarian dish g/2`

Output 1: `The habit 'Run 2.4km' has been added to goal '[EX] Exercise more'`\
Output 2: `The habit 'Do 20 pushups' has been added to goal '[EX] Exercise more'`\
Output 3: `The habit 'Learn a vegetarian dish' has been added to goal '[FD] Become a vegetarian'`

> üìÉ You should notice a list of habits to be done on the main interface whenever a new habit is added.

### Change a Habit: `change`
Change and update the name and/or interval of a habit.

**Format:** `change g/<goal_index> h/<habit_index> { n/<habit_name> i/<interval> }`
* You may change either the `habit_name` or `interval` at a time, but not both
* There must be at least one parameter changed - otherwise why call this command at all?

**Example:**\
Input 1: `change g/2 h/1 i/7`\
Input 2: `change n/Do 30 pushups h/2 g/1`

Output 1: `The habit 'Learn a vegetarian dish' of goal 'Become a vegetarian' has its interval changed to '7'`\
Output 2: `The habit 'Do 20 pushups' of goal 'Exercise more' has been changed to 'Do 30 pushups'`

> üìÉ Only one parameter can be updated at a time (to be changed to multiple parameters in v2.1)

### Complete a Habit: `done`
Mark a habit under a goal as done.\
(Congratulations on the completed habit... for that cycle :P)

**Format:** `done g/<goal_index> h/<habit_index>`

**Example:**
```
Command: done g/1 h/1
```

**Output:**
```
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The habit 'Run 2.4km' of goal '[EX] Exercise more' has been completed for 28102021 to 04112021.
The next interval will begin on 05112021
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### Delete a Habit: `delete`
Deletes a habit under a goal.\
(This should be used a last resort. Don't give up, hang in there and try completing your tasks.)

**Format:** `delete g/<goal_index> h/<habit_index>`

**Example:**
```
Command: delete g/1 h/2
```

**Output:**
```
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The habit 'Do 30 pushups' of goal '[EX] Exercise more' has been deleted.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### View all Habits: `view`
List all habits under a specific goal.

**Format:** `view g/<goal_index>`

**Example:**
```
Command: view g/1
```

**Output:**
```
1 habit(s) currently being tracked for Exercise more:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Index   | Name       | Interval   | Completion   | Completed   | Remaining   | Expired   | Streak   |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1       | Run 2.4km  | 7          | 20%          | 1           | 4           | 0         | 1        |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Return to Start-Up: `return`
Return to the start-up interface.\
(Where did that bring you? Back to the start.)

**Format:** `return`

**Example:**
```
Command: return
```

**Output:**
```

## About Loading and Saving Data
**Loading saved data:**

Whenever you run the program, the program will **automatically** look for any
saved data in the relative storage path, `data/habits.txt`.
* If the storage file is found, `File exists` will be printed.
* If the storage file is not found, the program will create
  one for you at the relative storage path, `data/habits.txt`.

**Saving data:**

* Everytime you make changes to any of your goals and habits, the changes
  are **immediately** reflected in the storage file. This is to ensure that in the
  event you closed the program without using the command `bye`, we can ensure that
  **most of your data are saved**.
* Before you exit the program, the goals you set and the habits you have added
  are **automatically** saved in a text file at the relative storage path, `data/habits.txt`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?
<br>
**A**: You can just copy-paste the habits.txt in the path `data/habits.txt` file from one computer to another and all
your data will be there!

> üí° **Pro Tip!** Have your home folder reside in a cloud storage service (OneDrive, iCloud, etc.) to sync your data
> between devices.

**Q**: Are there any books you recommend?
<br>
**A**: Data Structures and Algorithms in Java &#8594; [here](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-2nd/dp/0672324539)
