## Design and Implementation

### Architecture

The diagram below shows the higher-level implementation of the interactions of all the components within `HappyBit` 

![Ui Diagram](Diagram Images/SystemArchitecture.png)

In the sections below, we will be explaining in detail how each compomponent works.

### UI component

**API** : `Ui.java`

How the `Ui` component works:
1. The `Ui` is called in 2 main classes - `GoalList` and `UiOverall`
2. For `GoalList`, functions that require printing of information will call `Ui`
   1. confirmation message of `addGoal()`
   2. confirmation message of `addHabitToGoal()`
   3. removed goal of `deleteGoal()`
   4. removed habit of `deleteHabitFromGoal()`
   5. confirmation message of `doneHabitFromGoal()`
   6. update message of `updateGoalName()`
   7. list of goals of `listGoals()`
   8. list of habits of `listHabitsFromGoal()`
3. For `UiOverall`, there is an inheritance of 2 classes - `UiStartup` and `UiMain`
   1. `UiStartup` handles the interface that provides a brief introduction to the application, and links to external 
      documentation.
   2. `UiMain` handles the interface for the main application.
4. The `Ui` is responsible for printing error messages raised by exceptions.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Ui` component when `run()` is called in the main
class `HappyBit.java`

![Ui Diagram](Diagram Images/UiDiagramCopy.png)

While the Sequence Diagram represents the normal flow of logic, there is a recursive definition that is not represented.
1. `:HappyBit` calls the method `handleState()` in `:State`
2. `handleState()` calls another method `mainState()` also in `:State`
3. `mainState()` will create a new `:UiMain` and calls a method `run()` on itself
4. `run()` returns a boolean value equivalent to whether the recursive call should be made
5. If the boolean value is true, `handleState()` would recursively call itself
6. If the boolean value is false, `handleState()` would pass the call back to `:HappyBit`

### Command component

When the user runs the Program, the main function dealing with the user's inputs is the `handleUserInput()` function
which obtains a `Command` object after parsing the input using the `Parser` component.

`Command` objects available are:
* `AddGoalCommand` - Adds a new Goal to the GoalList.
* `AddHabitCommand` - Adds a new Habit object to a specified Goal set by the user.
* `DeleteGoalCommand` - Deletes a Goal from the GoalList
* `DeleteHabitCommand` - Deletes a Habit object from a specified Goal set by the user.
* `DoneHabitCommand` - Marks a Habit object under a Goal as done.
* `ListGoalCommand` - Lists out all the Goals set by the user.
* `ListHabitCommand` - Lists out all the Habits set under a Goal.
* `HelpCommand` - Prints out message indicating all the available Commands

The respective `runCommand` functions of the returned command object is then executed.
In the sections below we will be providing implementation details for each of the commands.

#### `AddGoalCommand`

When the `runCommand` function is executed for the `AddGoalCommand` object, the following steps as indicated by the
sequence diagram below is carried out.

#### `AddHabitCommand`

#### `DeleteGoalCommand`

#### `DeleteHabitCommand`

#### `DoneHabitCommand`

When the `runCommand` function is executed for the `DoneHabitCommand` object, the following steps as indicated by the 
sequence diagram below is carried out.

![](Diagram Images/DoneCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### `ListGoalCommand`

When the `runCommand` function is executed for the `ListGoalsCommand` object, the following steps as indicated by the
sequence diagram below is carried out.

![](Diagram Images/ListGoalsCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### `ListHabitCommand`

When the `runCommand` function is executed for the `ListHabitsCommand` object, the following steps as indicated by the
sequence diagram below is carried out.

![](Diagram Images/ListHabitsCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### `HelpCommand`

When the `runCommand` function is executed for the `HelpCommand` object, it instantiates a `PrintManager` object and 
calls the `printCommandList` method which prints out a pre-set message informing the user of all the inputs they
can type to execute a certain command.

### Parser logic component

The `Parser` logic component handles the parsing of the input passed in by the user and returns a suitable `Command` 
object that will be executed. Within the component itself, there are more specific and detailed `Parser` classes for 
handling various inputs from the user.

* `AddParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `set` and `add` keywords
* `DeleteParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `remove` and `delete`
* `DoneParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `done`
* `ListParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `view`
* `SetParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `goal`

For inputs of `bye`, `help` `list` their respective functions are run immediately without the need to parse further.

For any other invalid inputs that do not start with the listed keywords, the `HelpCommand` functionality is invoked.

### GoalList component

The `GoalList` component is the component that holds and manipulates the list of all the Goals set by the user.
All `runCommands` of all of the `Command` objects directly access the `GoalList` component to retrieve and change      
the user's data.

### Storage component

**API:** `Storage.java`

![Storage Class Diagram](Diagram%20Images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The Storage Class allows data to be read from and saved to a storage file. When a user exits the program, the 
information entered by the user during the program will be exported and saved into a `HappyBit.txt` file. The next time
the program is run by the user, this data will be imported back into the program to allow the user to pick up and 
continue from where they left off.

## Appendix A: Product Scope

### Target user profile:
* wants to have a work-life balance but is often consumed by work/school
* have goals and aspirations but falls short of them; lacklustre commitment or game plan for action
* doesn't want to rely on smartphone (They're doing everything these days, sheesh!)
* prefers desktop app, 
* familiar and comfortable with CLI apps, or willing to learn to use

### Value proposition

Users with _Ha(ppy)Bit_ will find themselves cultivating good habits and breaking bad habits despite hectic 
workload or commitments.
