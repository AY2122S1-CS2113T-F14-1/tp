## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview of Ha(ppy)Bit

Ha(ppy)Bit is a desktop application aimed to empower students to achieve their goalsâ€”whether personal, academical, or 
healthâ€”amidst the hectic and stressful university life, through cultivating good habits. The application operates on a 
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still comprising features typically found in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
Students who type fast will find that Ha(ppy)Bit performs habit tracking more efficiently than your conventional GUI 
applications.

### 1.2. Terminology

Name     | Description                                                 | Example
-----    | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------
Goal     | A long term achievement you wish to accomplish.             |`Lose 5kg by Dec`
Habit    | Small, actionable tasks to be done to achieve goal.         |`Run 5km`
Interval | The frequency (in days) which you want the habit to recur.  |`Run 5km every 7 days`

One goal can have one or more habits.\
One habit can have one or more intervals.

### 1.3. Icons and Format

## 2. Setting Up

### 2.1. Application Requirements

1. Ensure that you have installed Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 11 on your computer. If you do not have it installed, 
   you may download it from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html).
2. Recommended to use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
3. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F14-1/tp), and clone the fork to your computer.

### 2.2. Project Set-Up

> âš  Follow the steps in the following guide exactly. Any deviations may result in the code failing to run as intended.

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA.
2. If you are currently on a project, close the project.
3. Navigate to `Plugins` and ensure that the Gradle plugin is enabled (Gradle is installed by default).
4. Open the project that was forked to your computer.
5. Set-up JDK 
   * Navigate to `File` > `Project Structure...` > `Project` 
   * Under `Project SDK`, add the JDK installed in Section 2.1.1
   * Under `Project Language Level`, choose `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`
6. Navigate to `Project` > `tp` > `src` > `main` > `happybit` > `HappyBit`
7. Locate the `main` method and click the green triangle on the left of it
8. If the code builds and runs with no issues, you are good.

## 3. Design

### 3.1. Overall Architecture

The architecture diagram below describes the high-level design of the application.

![Ui Diagram](Diagram%20Images/Design%20Diagram%20Images/OverallArchitecture.png)

The 5 main components of the architecture diagram are:
1. `Ui` : User interface of the application
2. `Parser` : Parses user inputs (checks if input is valid and logic is correct)
3. `Command` : Executes the user commands
4. `Goal` : Contains the data of all goals, habits and intervals, as well as the logic to update them
5. `Storage` : Facilitates transfer of data between the application and external storage files

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the
command `remove g/1` to remove the goal at index 1.

![Ui Diagram](Diagram%20Images/Design%20Diagram%20Images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

### 3.2. UI Component

The UI component is responsible for all user interfaces of the application. However, the component is further divided
into 2 sub-components: `UiManager.java` for static interface displays, and `PrintManager.java` for dynamic interface
displays (display messages in response to user input).

**API:** `UiManager.java`

![Ui Manager](Diagram%20Images/Design%20Diagram%20Images/UiManager.png)

1. `UiStartup` will be called upon starting the application (we refer to this as the start state).
2. `UiMain` will be called upon entering the main state of the application (the main state is entered when you select
    the option `[5] Start Application` in the start state).
3. `UiMain` calls `Goal` to display a static view of all habits to be done for the day.
4. `UiMain` calls `Storage` to display alerts for status of storage imports and exports.

**API:** `PrintManager.java`

![Print Manager](Diagram%20Images/Design%20Diagram%20Images/PrintManager.png)

1. `PrintManager` is called upon by user commands to display text or error messages.
2. `PrintManager` may call `PrintTable` to print a list of items in a tabular format.
3. `PrintManager` calls `Goal` to obtain goal-related information for printing.

### 3.3. Parser Component

The `Parser` logic component handles the parsing of the input passed in by the user and returns a suitable `Command`
object that will be executed. Within the component itself, there are more specific and detailed `Parser` classes for
handling various inputs from the user.

![](Diagram Images/Design Diagram Images/MainParserSequenceDiagram.png)

* `AddParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `set` and `add` keywords
* `DeleteParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `remove` and `delete`
* `DoneParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `done`
* `ListParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `view`
* `SetParser` - Handles the parsing of inputs starting with `goal`

For inputs of `bye`, `help` `list` their respective functions are run immediately without the need to parse further.

For any other invalid inputs that do not start with the listed keywords, the `HelpCommand` functionality is invoked.

While the Sequence Diagram represents the normal flow of logic, there is a recursive definition that is not represented.
1. `:HappyBit` calls the method `handleState()` in `:State`
2. `handleState()` calls another method `mainState()` also in `:State`
3. `mainState()` will create a new `:UiMain` and calls a method `run()` on itself
4. `run()` returns a boolean value equivalent to whether the recursive call should be made
5. If the boolean value is true, `handleState()` would recursively call itself
6. If the boolean value is false, `handleState()` would pass the call back to `:HappyBit`.

### 3.4. Command Component

When the user runs the Program, the main function dealing with the user's inputs is the `processInput` function in `UiMain.java`
which obtains a `Command` object after parsing the input using the `Parser` component.

`Command` objects available are:
* `AddGoalCommand` - Adds a new Goal to the GoalList.
* `AddHabitCommand` - Adds a new Habit object to a specified Goal set by the user.
* `UpdateGoalCommand` - Updates attributes for a Goal [Name, End Date or Type]
* `UpdateHabitCommand` - Updates attributes for a Habit [Name or Interval]
* `DeleteGoalCommand` - Deletes a Goal from the GoalList
* `DeleteHabitCommand` - Deletes a Habit object from a specified Goal set by the user.
* `DoneHabitCommand` - Marks a Habit object under a Goal as done.
* `ListGoalCommand` - Lists out all the Goals set by the user.
* `ListHabitCommand` - Lists out all the Habits set under a Goal.
* `HelpCommand` - Prints out message indicating all the available Commands

The respective `runCommand` functions of the returned command object is then executed.
In the sections below we will be providing implementation details for each of the commands.

### 3.5. Goal Component

The `GoalList` component is the component that holds and manipulates the list of all the Goals set by the user.
All `runCommands` of all of the `Command` objects directly access the `GoalList` component to retrieve and change      
the user's data.

### 3.6. Storage Component

The `Storage` class allows data to be read from and saved to a storage file.
The class diagram shows the interactions between the different classes.

![Storage Class Diagram](Diagram%20Images/Design%20Diagram%20Images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram shows how the program imports data from storage file.

![Import Sequence Diagram](Diagram Images/Implementation Diagram Images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

The program uses `Storage` class to import data from the storage file.
* `Storage` interacts with `Import` to access the data stored in storage file.
* `Import` will depend on `ImportParser` to decipher the data stored, and return 
  a `Goal`, `Habit` or `Interval` object back to `Import` correspondingly.
* `Import` will then populate `GoalList` accordingly
  before returning `GoalList` back to `Storage` and back to user.

The sequence diagram shows how the program exports data to storage file.

![Export Sequence Diagram](Diagram Images/Implementation Diagram Images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

`Storage` class can also export data to storage file with `Export` class.
It takes in a `GoalList` object and converts the data into string to be stored in storage file.

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1. Adding a Goal
